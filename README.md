# Overview Of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members within this dataset. This was done by extracting the data sets, and using PySpark to perform the ETL process by connecting to a AWS RDS instance, and loading the data sets into pgAdmin. Later the vine data was loaded into Pandas where the data was analyzed further.
